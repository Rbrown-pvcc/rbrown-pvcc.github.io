<h1 style="color:#3366cc;">Chapter 1: An Introduction to Computer Science</h1>
<h2 style="color:#3366cc;">Student: Rory Brown</h2>

<h2 style="color:#009966;">Three Misconceptions about Computer Science</h2>
<ol> 
  <li>Computer science is the study of computers</li>
  <li>Computer science is the study of how to write computer programs</li>
  <li>Computer science is the study of the uses and applications of computers and software</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color:#009966;">Briefly Define:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Computer science: The study of algorithms, including their mathematical properties, hardware, and linguistic realizations and their applications.</li>
  <li>Algorithms: A step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.</li>
  <li>Sequential Operation: A process where instructions are executed one after another in a fixed order.</li>
  <li>Conditional Operation: Question-based instructions in an algorithm; the next step depends on circumstances.</li>
  <li>Iterative Operation: "Looping" instructions of an algorithm. Repeat previous instructions until an intended result is acquired.</li>        
  <li>Stored program computer: A computer that keeps both programs and data in its memory.</li>
  <li>Programmer: A person who writes and tests code.</li>
  <li>Integrated circuit: A small electronic chip combining many parts like switches and wires to perform a specific task, e.g., a smartphone.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color:#009966;">Briefly describe these computer generations:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>First generation (1940s-1950s): Used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory; large, slow, and generated a lot of heat.</li>
  <li>Second generation (1950s-1960s): Used transistors replacing vacuum tubes; smaller and faster.</li>
  <li>Third generation (1960s-1970s): Used integrated circuits; more reliable, more powerful, and efficient. This era saw the development of operating systems and keyboards/monitors.</li>
  <li>Fourth generation (1970s-1980s): Used microprocessors; personal computers emerged. Rise of GUIs, the mouse, and development of the internet.</li>
  <li>Fifth generation (1990-present): Uses artificial intelligence and advanced computing technologies, including quantum computing; focused on systems that learn and adapt.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color:#ff6600;">FORTRAN:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>What does the acronym FORTRAN stand for?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">Formula translation</p>
  </li>
  <li>When was FORTRAN developed?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">1957</p>
  </li>
  <li>What was it used for?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">Scientific and engineering calculations</p>
  </li>
  <li>Is FORTRAN still being used today? If so, what for?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">Yes, for advanced scientific computations and simulations</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color:#ff6600;">COBOL:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>What does the acronym COBOL stand for?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">Common business-oriented language</p>
  </li>
  <li>When was COBOL developed?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">1959</p>
  </li>
  <li>What was it used for?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">Business, finance, and administrative systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>Is COBOL still being used today? If so, what for?
    <p style="color:#3366cc;">Yes, in legacy banking and government systems</p>
  </li>
